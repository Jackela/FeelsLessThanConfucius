# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Cultural Irony: Plan demonstrates satire that critiques ideas, not identities;
  includes safeguards against targeting protected characteristics.
- Technological Transparency: Define provenance logging fields per response
  (model, prompt template version, sources, params, confidence) and `/provenance`
  exposure with trace ids.
- Module Autonomy: Document clear contracts for rag/llm/tts/live2d; no cross‑module
  hidden coupling; identify adapter strategy for swapability.
- Lightweight First: Prefer prompt + LoRA; justify any heavy training; include
  latency budgets and caching/streaming approach.
- Compliance & Safety: Integrate input/output moderation and red‑team prompts;
  scope limited to cultural satire; prohibit hate/polarization.
- SLAs: Show how text < 2 s p95 and TTS+Live2D < 1.5 s p95 will be measured.

## Engineering Integrity Gates

- TDD: List tests to be written first and the red→green plan.
- DbC: Define pre/postconditions and invariants for each contract.
- DDD: Identify domains, bounded contexts, and aggregates impacted.
- Change set discipline: For each module change, include tests, updated
  `*.spec.md`, and synchronized `AGENTS.md` descriptors in the same PR.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
